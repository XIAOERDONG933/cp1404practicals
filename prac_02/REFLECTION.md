Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

So far, I have watched 10 lectures. These videos cover the basics of the course 
as well as some in-depth topics, and I 
plan to continue to complete all remaining videos on time.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch lecture videos at home in the afternoon of my spare time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think what I do well is that when I meet a problem,
I don't give up but keep looking for a way to solve it.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I found myself needing to stop relying too much on video learning 
and instead add more hands-on parts.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

At the moment I am really doing poorly in practice in this subject, especially in time management. 
I found myself wasting a lot of time on practical tasks, leading to inefficiency. 
I will change the way I learn this subject.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

What I have done well in the practice of this subject is my attitude 
of continuous learning and improvement. Every time I finish a task or project, 
I take time for self-reflection to figure out what I did well and what I need to improve.
