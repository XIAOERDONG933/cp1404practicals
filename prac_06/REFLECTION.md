# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Through the course learning, I can use different functions more flexibly to complete tasks.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think it takes me too long to complete the task at this stage, 
and I can shorten the completion time as much as possible through proficient coding.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think the part that I've done well is being able to spend time looking at functions, and I'll stick with that.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I think I need to stop doing homework after too long intervals between classes, 
which causes me to miss out on my memory of the class.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

None.
